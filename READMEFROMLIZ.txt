Hello! Here is all the information on running scSPRITE

Raw mouse sample 1: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX8722756[accn]
Raw mouse sample 2: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX8722757[accn]

The raw data used to test functionality of our pipeline was found at the SRA line from data availability.

    From here you should see tabs for FASTQ download if you ever need to download data.
    
    
Data storage and location: raw fastq files for analysis are stored at raw_fastq. I have kept old or supporting files for these in the folder fastqDir. Paola has said that scSPRITE can only run one sample at a time, so I would leave all other files in fastqDir while you are running analysis on one sample in raw_fastq. There should be two files in raw_fastq: R1 and R2. When it is running, it might create a 3rd file in raw_fastq acknowledging the name of the sample. 

The naming format of your sample reads should match the one I have used, the format set by the creators, or else it will not run. 
i.e. SRR12212045_1.fq.gz
You are more than welcome to edit the code to take different naming formats, but I found it easier to stick to the syntax they wrote the code around. Make sure it is zipped .gz too!


RUNNING THE PIPELINE: 
1) Navigate to /blue/giustirodriguezp/PROJECTS/Sprite/Guttman_Ismagilov_Labs/scSPRITE and open terminal. If you are reading this you are probably already in the right file location.

2) Load snakemake by typing "ml snakemake/9.4.0". Load java by typing "ml java". Load samtools by typing "ml samtools".

3) Do a dry run by typing "snakemake -n". If there are no major errors, you are good to go.

4) First step snakemake run: snakemake --cores 15

5) Second step snakemake run: snakemake -s Snakefile_contact_heatmap --cores 15

Notes for why scSPRITE needs edits:

4/10/25:
the code does not make its own new_fastq folder. i made one manually, but mkdir command in the snakefile around line 89 is ideal for future use.

4/18/25:
Only one sample runs at a time. I recommend moving you raw data and other materials to fastqDir until you need it. Move it to raw_fastq when you're ready.

5/19/25:
Andre says theres a mystery python package, possibly custom, for run "Snakefile_contact_heatmap". It is called "contact" and I still haven't gotten to the second step so I'm not really sure what it does.
